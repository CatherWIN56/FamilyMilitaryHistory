                <div class="info-text"> While sitting in her ACT/SAT Prep Focus
                    Period her junior year of high school, her teacher at the time
                    had assigned the class to practice writing college essays.
                    Catherine, having no plans to attend college, was watching YouTube
                    videos. Her teacher asked her if she planned on flipping burgers
                    for the rest of her life. She, after looking down and seeing an
                    ad to join the military, replied saying she was going to join the
                    Army. The teacher then stated that she would never make it through
                    Basic Training. This sparked something in her to prove that teacher
                    wrong. She spoke to a recruiter that night and was raising
                    her right hand and signing the dotted line just two weeks later.
                    She attended Basic Training following her high school graduation, which
                    she not only passed, but was promoted ahead of peers due to good performance.
