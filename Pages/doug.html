                    Douglas, commonly known as Doug, was born on May 15, 1956, in Marshall, 
                    Minnesota, but primarily resided in the quaint town of Minneota, 
                    Minnesota. As the third child among four boys and one girl, with his 
                    sister being the youngest, Doug grew up in a vibrant household. 
                    Throughout his formative years, he displayed a penchant for athleticism 
                    and engagement in various extracurricular activities, including baseball, 
                    swimming, diving, roller skating, wrestling, and dancing. Renowned for his 
                    sociability and affable demeanor, Doug enjoyed a notable level of popularity 
                    during his high school years. His academic journey unfolded within the 
                    confines of local educational institutions, wherein he spent the entirety 
                    of his childhood in Minneota, fostering strong ties to his community.

                <div class="info-text"> 
                    At the age of 17, Doug made a decisive career choice to enlist in 
                    the United States Navy, a decision that entailed leaving high school 
                    prematurely. With the supportive consent of his parents, Doug embarked 
                    on his military journey, epitomizing a resolute commitment to service. 
                    During his tenure in the Navy, he pursued his educational advancement 
                    by obtaining his GED while fulfilling his duties as a hull technician. 
                    As an integral member of the damage control team, Doug played a pivotal 
                    role in training fellow servicemen in damage control procedures. His 
                    responsibilities extended to conducting nondestructive testing, employing 
                    techniques such as ultrasounds and x-rays to assess the integrity of welds. 
                    Engaging in hazardous tasks involving radiation, Doug adhered to stringent 
                    safety protocols, including the utilization of radiation-tracking devices. 
                    Stationed aboard a ship in San Diego, CA, Doug's service took him to the 
                    waters adjacent to Vietnam during the concluding stages of the war. Notably, 
                    he participated in clandestine operations, including a covert land mission 
                    aimed at facilitating the evacuation of military personnel from Vietnam, 
                    showcasing his versatility and valor in the face of adversity.

                <h1 class="h1-c" id="career">Career</h1>
                <div class="info-text">Following the completion of his four-year contract with the United 
                    States Navy, Doug transitioned to the Minnesota Army National Guard, 
                    concurrently embarking on a new chapter in his personal life by 
                    marrying Gina Flood. During his tenure in the National Guard, Doug and 
                    Gina welcomed two children, Angela and Nick. However, amidst economic 
                    challenges in 1982, Doug faced the daunting prospect of supporting his 
                    growing family, prompting his decision to reenlist in the Navy.
                    <br><br>
                    Stationed aboard the USS Ranger in San Diego, CA, Doug found himself 
                    confronting perilous circumstances when a devastating fire erupted onboard 
                    while the ship was traversing the Indian Ocean. As part of a courageous team, 
                    Doug played a pivotal role in containing the fire, safeguarding the vessel and 
                    its crew. Amidst the chaos, Doug's unwavering commitment to his family remained 
                    steadfast, providing support to Gina as they navigated the challenges of 
                    relocation and adaptation to their new surroundings.
                    <br><br>
                    Throughout his extensive naval career, Doug demonstrated exceptional 
                    professionalism and resilience, consistently rising to the occasion in the 
                    face of adversity. From San Diego, CA, Doug's assignments took him on a whirlwind 
                    journey across various naval bases and deployments. After the fire incident on the 
                    USS Ranger, Doug and his family were relocated to Bremerton, Washington, where the 
                    aircraft carrier was refitted. Subsequently, Doug underwent non-destructive testing 
                    school in San Diego, before being stationed at Naval Submarine Base Bangor, Washington, 
                    for three years. Following this, a two-year assignment in Guam first on the USS Proteus.  
                    This offered a unique experience of serving on a submarine tender. Doug followed this ship
                    back to the states to be decomissioned in which time his family back on guam 
                    endured the trials of a significant typhoon, the largest to hit the island in a long 
                    while and an 8.3 sized earthquake.
                    <br><br>
                    Doug's career trajectory then led him back to Guam for another stint on the USS 
                    Holland, further enriching his naval experience. Despite his desire to be stationed 
                    at Great Lakes, IL, the Navy had other plans, initially intending to send him to 
                    Japan. However, last-minute orders rerouted him to the San Diego Naval Base, where he 
                    undertook teaching duties in non-destructive testing. The eventual closure of the school 
                    prompted another relocation, this time to Great Lakes, IL, where Doug continued his 
                    teaching responsibilities until his retirement decision. Throughout his military journey, 
                    Doug's steadfast dedication to his family, unwavering professionalism, and adaptability 
                    in the face of shifting assignments and challenges underscored his distinguished naval 
                    career.

                <div class="info-text">Following his retirement from the Navy in 1999, 
                    Doug transitioned to civilian employment, securing a position at MQS 
                    in Milwaukee where he specialized in nondestructive testing for a 
                    duration of five years. Subsequently, he advanced to MetalTek International, 
                    assuming the role of supervisor and radiation safety officer for 
                    nondestructive testing operations. Doug's tenure at Medal Tech spanned an 
                    impressive 18 years, during which he found fulfillment in teaching and 
                    guiding his colleagues while exhibiting a steadfast dedication to his 
                    profession. Unfortunately, his career was interrupted by a stroke in 2018, 
                    compelling him to retire. 
                    <br><br>
                    Doug and his wife, Gina, had already made plans to 
                    relocate to Mount Zion, IL, to be closer to their daughter, Angela, and her 
                    family, as their son, serving in the Active-duty Army, experienced frequent 
                    relocations. This strategic decision ensured consistency and familial support 
                    during their retirement years. Settling into their new home, Doug cherished 
                    his retirement, enjoying precious moments with his beloved dog, Eddie, 
                    indulging in a purchase of a VW convertable, and relishing quality time with 
                    Gina and their cherished grandchildren. Throughout his retirement years, 
                    Doug remained a devoted family man, finding joy and fulfillment in the company 
                    of his loved ones.
                    <br><br>
                    On Wednesday, February 7, 2024, Douglas departed this world, 
                    leaving behind a legacy of love, strength, and unwavering commitment to his 
                    family and community.
