                <div class="info-text">Born on June 2nd, 1977, in Chicago, Christopher's 
                    journey through education took him from various suburbs in the Chicagoland 
                    area, including Bolingbrook and Gurnee, before settling in Lake Forest/Lake 
                    Bluff in 1991 for his 8th-grade year. Graduating from high school in 1995, 
                    he continued his academic pursuit at the College of Lake County in Grayslake, 
                    IL, where he obtained an Associate Degree in Arts in 1998. Christopher then 
                    ventured further south to Daytona Beach, FL, home to the renowned Embry-Riddle 
                    Aeronautical University, often dubbed the "Harvard of the Skies" (lol), where 
                    he earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Science in May 2001. 
                    With his educational achievements under his belt, Christopher was poised to 
                    take flight into the aviation industry, equipped with knowledge and determination 
                    to make a significant impact.

                <div class="info-text"> 
                    Motivated by a profound sense of duty and a desire to serve 
                    his country in the aftermath of the tragic events of September 
                    11, 2001, Christopher made a pivotal decision to join the United 
                    States Army Reserve on November 19 of the same year. Enlisting 
                    as a 46Q, a Public Affairs, Media Relations, and 
                    Photo/Journalism Specialist, he became an integral part of the 416th 
                    Theatre Engineering Command based in Darien, IL.
                    Despite his unwavering commitment to his nation, Christopher made the deeply personal 
                    choice not to pursue active duty, recognizing the importance of 
                    remaining close to his two children, Michelle and Alyssa, at the 
                    time. His decision to serve in the Reserve underscored his 
                    dedication to both his country and his family, embodying the 
                    selflessness and sacrifice of a true patriot.

                <h1 class="h1-c" id="career">Career</h1>
                <div class="info-text">Despite his background in aviation, Christopher's 
                    desire to serve his country in a different capacity led him to explore 
                    alternative career paths. Intent on pursuing a career in journalism, he 
                    encountered unexpected challenges with a newspaper scandal that halted 
                    his plans. Undeterred, he embarked on a journey with the military, where 
                    he found purpose and fulfillment. His dedication to serving his country 
                    remained steadfast, even as personal milestones intersected with his military 
                    career. While on an exercise with the 416th in Panama, Christopher received 
                    news that he and his partner Angela were expecting a child, Dylan, adding a 
                    new dimension to his sense of responsibility.
                    <br><br>
                    As the surge in Iraq unfolded in 2004-2005, Christopher faced pivotal decisions 
                    regarding his military career. Though he initially aspired to pursue a commission 
                    as a Regular Line Officer (RLO), he ultimately opted to become a Warrant Officer, 
                    drawn by the unique opportunities and responsibilities it offered. Navigating 
                    through bureaucratic hurdles, Christopher's determination and resourcefulness 
                    propelled him forward. His journey took him to flight school from 2007-2009, 
                    where his exceptional performance earned him a full-time National Guard position 
                    flying for counter-drug and homeland security units in Decatur. During his time 
                    at flight school, Christopher recieved news that he and his partner Angela were 
                    expecting their second child together, Dalton.
                    <br><br>
                    Throughout his military career, Christopher's partnership with Angela remained a 
                    source of strength and support. Their marriage in 2008 in Dothan, AL, marked a new 
                    chapter in their lives, prompting a relocation to Decatur following Christopher's 
                    return from flight school and the ~offical~ gaining of his step-daughter, Catherine. 
                    During his time at the unit in Decatur, Christopher was 
                    offered the oppornity to deploy to Saudi Arabia during the height of the Afghanistan
                    Retrograde in 2021 and 2022, he was located there for 15 months, with a short journey 
                    home in Mount Zion, IL for the holiday, returning to Saudi Arabia to finish out his 15 
                    months. Christopher's journey epitomizes the sacrifices and 
                    triumphs of military service, underscored by his unwavering commitment to his 
                    family and his nation.

                <div class="info-text">Looking ahead to the future, Christopher harbors 
                    aspirations of transitioning to fixed-wing aircraft, a goal he has 
                    long pursued. Despite encountering obstacles in Decatur due to 
                    entrenched social dynamics, Christopher's determination remained 
                    unwavering. Following his tenure as a Battalion Aviation Element 
                    (BAE) for the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC), he made a 
                    strategic move, transferring to the United States Army Reserve 
                    (USAR) to fly MEDEVAC missions, aiming to strike a balance between 
                    his military career and personal life, particularly as he was also 
                    flying for commercial airlines at the time. However, unforeseen 
                    challenges emerged with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, disrupting 
                    his plans to qualify for UH-60M and undergo MEDEVAC training. Faced 
                    with adversity, Christopher embarked on a new chapter by accepting 
                    opportunities abroad, applying for positions with C12 and JetBlue 
                    while stationed in Saudi Arabia. His perseverance and adaptability 
                    ultimately paid off when he received acceptance offers from both 
                    airlines on the same day, signaling a promising trajectory for his 
                    future endeavors in aviation.
